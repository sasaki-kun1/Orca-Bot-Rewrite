# Orca-Bot-Rewrite
This repository contains open source code for my Discord Bot named Orca. This is a complete rewrite from the original. The purpose of this rewrite is to support Discord slash commands, create new commands, and clean up/fix old code from the original. Keep in mind that this bot and this repository is a work in progress. Not all parts of the code is guarenteed to work.
